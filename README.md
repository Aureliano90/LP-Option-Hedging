# LP-Option-Hedging

### Description
A Python program to analyze leveraged liquidity mining/yield farming[1] and find the optimal option combination for
hedging impermanent loss, which may allow arbitrage. Initially written in May for my personal use. Optimized by 30x
with Numba. Restructured and added annotations to make it more approaching.

### Utility
The code may plot PnL graphs for leveraged liquidity provider (LP) positions on constant product Automated Market Maker
(AMM)[2], like those on [Alpha Homora](https://homora.alphafinance.io/) and [Alpaca Finance](https://www.alpacafinance.org/).
It can perform a variational search for the optimal combination of call options and put options which minimizes
impermanent loss in leveraged LP. It then plots the PnL graphs for leveraged LP, the option combination with sizes and
strike prices, and the combination of leveraged LP and options.

The type of leveraged LP can be borrowing USD stablecoins, borrowing cryptos like BTC, ETH, and a pseudo delta neutral
combination of the two.

Parameters that need to be manually specified:
* debt type
* leverage of LP
* LTV at liquidation
* APRs on farming
* annualized volatility, risk-free interest rate
* days to expiration and day of exercise/reselling of European options priced by the Black-Scholes model[3]

### Background
Providing liquidity on AMM is equivalent to short gamma and long theta, i.e. the LP subjects itself to impermanent loss
in exchange for trading fees and liquidity mining rewards. On the other hand, long call and long put have positive gamma
and negative theta. By virtue of the Carr–Madan formula[4], a smooth function of the underlying price, in this case the
payoff of leveraged LP, can be replicated by a series of European options at continuous strikes. Hence it is possible to
completely hedge leveraged LP with options. In pratice options are not available at any strike. Moreover the volatility
is not constant at all strikes due to the volatility smile. Therefore the current program only considers a long call and
a long put for hedging.

### Disclaimer
The hedging is only approximate and theoretical. The author is not responsible for any loss caused by the use of this
program. Do your own research.
